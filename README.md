<H1> This Python code is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. </H1>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
    - Pygame is imported, and necessary constants are defined, including the screen dimensions, grid size, and images for the snake segments and food.

Overall, this code sets up a simple Snake game where the player controls the snake to eat food, growing longer with each piece of food eaten, and ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.
